Generate a slippy map (aka Google Style map) from high resolution images or pdf.

For your first try at generating a slippy map, use a pdf.

We can also render jpeg, png, and gif, but these don't look very good unless
the image is at least 2000 x 2000 resolution.

To render a pdf

  make_slippy_map.pl filename.pdf

This will create a subdirectory. Within is an index.html that
can be displayed in a web browser

To render a directory full of graphics files

  make_slippy_map.pl graphics_directory

This will render all graphics within, and produce a gallery web page
that organizes said graphics.
