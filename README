Create Google Style maps from high resolution images or pdf.

Your first step is to get a pdf file, like say Stanford's map.
  http://www-facilities.stanford.edu/maps/download/VisitorMap.pdf

We can also render jpeg, png, and gif, but these don't look very good unless
the image is at least 2000 x 2000 resolution.

To render a pdf
  ./make_ajax.pl filename.pdf
This will create a subdirectory. Within is an index.html that
can be displayed in a web browser

To render a directory full of pdf files, a la gallery style
  ./make_ajax.pl pdf_directory

To read up on other options
  ./make_ajax.pl

To run the gallery test case, fill the gallery_test subdirectory with 
pdf files. Then

  perl gallery_test.t
